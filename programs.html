    <!-- ===================== WHAT WE DO ===================== -->
    <section class="what-we-do">
        <h2>Our Core Programs</h2>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>1. Safe Shelter & Child Protection</h3>
            <p>We provide a secure home environment for children who have faced abuse or are at risk of harm. Our shelters offer 24-hour protection, meals, clothing, and psychosocial support while ensuring each child’s right to feel safe and cared for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>2. Trauma Counseling & Healing</h3>
            <p>Through professional social workers and counselors, we offer individual and group therapy sessions that help survivors process trauma, rebuild confidence, and recover emotionally.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>3. Education & Skill Development</h3>
            <p>Education is at the heart of our mission. We partner with local schools and training centers to ensure that every child under our care returns to education or acquires vocational skills suited to their interests and talents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>4. Empowerment for the Girl & Boy Child</h3>
            <p>We run mentorship and empowerment programs that teach life skills, leadership, self-defense, and reproductive health awareness. Both girls and boys learn about respect, equality, and positive masculinity — breaking the silence and stigma around assault.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>5. Community Outreach & Advocacy</h3>
            <p>We work with communities to raise awareness about child abuse, early marriage, and gender-based violence. Our outreach programs encourage reporting, promote prevention, and strengthen families through parenting workshops and home visits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h3>6. Livelihood & Sustainability Projects</h3>
            <p>To support long-term independence, we run small-scale agribusinesses, tailoring workshops, and eco-craft projects. These ventures not only sustain the Foundation financially but also provide training and employment for older youth and community members.</p>

    <!-- ===================== OUR APPROACH ===================== -->
    <section class="approach">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>Our model is holistic and survivor-centered. Every child who joins our care receives:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A personalized recovery plan (shelter, health, and education)</li>
            <li>Trauma-informed counseling and emotional support</li>
            <li>Access to safe learning environments</li>
            <li>Reintegration support for returning safely to family or independent living</li>
            <li>Ongoing mentorship to ensure continued growth and stability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We believe healing is not just about survival — it’s about restoration, empowerment, and belonging.</p>

    <!-- ===================== GOVERNANCE ===================== -->
    <section class="governance">
        <h2>Governance & Sustainability</h2>
        <p>The Foundation operates under a Board of Trustees, guided by child protection specialists, educators, and counselors. A team of dedicated staff and volunteers ensures the safe, efficient, and compassionate operation of all programs.</p>

        <p>Our sustainability model includes donor partnerships, community contributions, and income-generating projects such as farming, tailoring, and eco-products. Profits are reinvested into child care, education, and health initiatives.</p>
