        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The Stephen & Grace Safe Haven Foundation was founded out of compassion and lived experience. It began as a small community effort to support vulnerable children in Arusha and grew into a structured organization recognized for its trauma-informed, survivor-centered approach.</p>
        <p>Over the years,we have worked with local authorities,social welfare offices,schools,and family to identify children in danger,rescue them from abusive situations, and help them rebuld their lives.
